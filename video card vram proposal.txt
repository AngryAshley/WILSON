 = VGA SPECS = 
vram will be 64k for a 320x200 resolution.
The VGA "Carrier" signal used will be 640x400@70
this signal divided by two will be the pixel clock for the rest of the video card.

 = THE FONT = 
The WILSON font uses 4 bits wide characters with blank space included.
320/80=4, so with a horizontal resolution of 320 and a 4 pixel wide font, 
80 characters would fit. The letters in the font are 5 bits wide and do NOT include
blank space between rows. The final row size would be 6 pixels high. 
200/25=8, so the 6 pixel high font would fit nicely. 
To get a 5x5 pixel font, the amount of columns must be reduced. 320/5=64, so with a 5x5 pixel
font, the maximum columns is just 64, which might be too little.

 = SOLUTIONS FOR MEMORY ACCESS =
VGA counter will read from the vram continuously
as soon as a write is done to the vram, the VGA Read and Write will be disconnected
and reconnected as soon as the computer is done writing to the card.
The video will draw black in a certain region for about a frame
The connection being 70 fps, the user won't see a thing.
This is probably the easiest route, as there is no special timing involved.
I am not sure about the visibility of the blanking of this method, 
but my hypothesis is that it should be okay.

Another option similar to the first one is to blank the screen entirely for one frame
while writing to the screen memory, where the blitter renders the entire screen bit by bit
This only has to happen when something gets written to screen memory. 

another option is to use a secondary RAM chip as buffer which gets written to continuously
and gets mirrored to the output RAM during the blanking lines of the VGA signal.

Yet another option is to have the blitter render every line of video during it's
blank interval every time, this saves a RAM chip in contrast to the previous idea.
